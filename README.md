# Linked HTML [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smalluban/linked-html.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smalluban/linked-html)

Linked HTML is a library for building dynamic user interfaces from static html content generated by any server-side language or template engine.

* **Fastboot data model:** Initial data model is extracted from static html
* **Native and simple syntax:** Links between html and data model are marked only by custom attributes. This ensures no conflict with syntax of any template engine.
* **Data binding**: Library uses one-way data binding with flexible watching control over primitive values, arrays and objects.
* **Superfast rendering**: Because view is pre-rendered, initializing library usually takes no DOM changes at all. On the other hand after model changes, markers uses reference tokens to re-use html nodes as much as possible.
* **Simple API**: The architecture covers only three simple concepts and compiled library weighs only 36KB / 9KB (gzip)
